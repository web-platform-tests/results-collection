# wpt.fyi: Guidelines for Maintainers

Thank you for your interest in helping maintain the WPT Dashboard! Here are the Pull Request and Issues guidelines and policies for Maintainers of the project:

## Moderating Discussion

Guidelines for issue reports and pull requests are included in this project’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Ensure that contributors honor these recommendations. Close discussions in any of the following events: 

1. The main description of the issue is no longer what is/was intended
  - If the description is inaccurate or describes something other than what is discussed in the issue, the issue should be closed.

2. The comment thread of an issue gets too long and contains more than just additions and clarifications.
  - The issue is no longer relevant or it has been resolved.
  - The issue is a request that is deemed “out of scope” for the project.
  - The issue contains content that violates the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Maintainers should review and post comments on pull requests within 3 business days. There is no guaranteed time box for pull requests to be closed with or without merge; however, make an effort to do so in a reasonable time frame.

## Reverting Patches

If you find a patch causes [wpt.fyi](http://wpt.fyi) to no longer function as intended, revert it immediately. Leave a comment detailing what happened as a result of the PR, and work with the contributor to resolve the problem and try again.
