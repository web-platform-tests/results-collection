      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>The WPT Dashboard, <a href="http://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a>, displays results for the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests">web-platform-tests</a>, or WPT, which are a group of test suites for many web platform specifications (each top-level directory of WPT is a different specification).</p>
      <p>If the web platform as a whole were an engineering project, it'd be crazy not to have a test suite that's run regularly. The goal of the WPT Dashboard is to promote viewing the web platform as one entity and to make identifying and fixing interoperability issues as easy as possible.</p>
      <p>The WPT Dashboard project is comprised of two parts:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><b>Running:</b> currently we try to run Chrome dev channel and Firefox nightly daily, with Edge and Safari soon to follow.</li>
          <li><b>Serving:</b> this site, <a href="http://wpt.fyi/">wpt.fyi</a>, displaying JSON result files loaded from cloud storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Source and Documentation</h2>
      <p>The source code for both running and serving test results is on <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/wptdashboard">GitHub</a>.</p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>Please file a <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/wptdashboard/issues/new">GitHub issue</a>. For other discussion, most people who contribute to the WPT Dashboard monitor the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-test-infra/">public-test-infra@w3c.org</a> mailing list.</p>
